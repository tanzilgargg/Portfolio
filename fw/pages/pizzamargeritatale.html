            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Pizza Margherita is a classic Neapolitan pizza that embodies the essence of Italian cuisine with its simplicity and quality ingredients. Created in 1889 by pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, this pizza was named in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy during her visit to Naples.</p>
                
                <p>The pizza's colors were intentionally chosen to represent the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil. This patriotic creation quickly became a symbol of Italian culinary tradition and is now recognized worldwide as one of the most authentic and delicious pizzas.</p>
                
                <p>What makes Pizza Margherita truly special is its adherence to traditional methods. The dough is made with just flour, water, salt, and yeast, then left to rise slowly. The tomatoes are San Marzano, grown in the volcanic soil of Mount Vesuvius, and the mozzarella is made from the milk of water buffalo raised in the Campania region. Fresh basil leaves are added just before serving, releasing their aromatic oils.</p>
                
                <p>In 2017, the art of Neapolitan pizza making was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, cementing its place as one of the world's most beloved dishes.</p>

            <p>Carbonara is a cornerstone of Roman cuisine, representing the city's ability to create extraordinary dishes from humble ingredients. Its origins are tied to coal workers (carbonai) who needed hearty, energy-rich meals.</p>
            <h2>Cooking Technique</h2>
            <p>The key to perfect carbonara lies in timing and temperature. The eggs must be mixed with hot pasta off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling. The guanciale is crisped to release its flavors into the dish.</p>
