            <h1 class="history-title">The Story of Butter Chicken </h1>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, was born in the heart of Delhi in the 1950s at the iconic Moti Mahal restaurant. It was invented by Kundan Lal Gujral, a Punjabi chef and restaurateur who was also one of the creators of the tandoori chicken. As legend goes, the dish was created as a happy accident — leftover tandoori chicken was mixed with a rich tomato-based gravy made with butter and cream to prevent it from drying out. This created a silky, flavorful curry that perfectly balanced spice and richness. It quickly became a favorite, both locally and internationally.</p>
                    
                <p>Chicken has grown to represent the warmth and indulgence of North Indian cuisine. It's often served during celebrations and special family meals, accompanied by naan or rice. Its creamy texture and mildly spiced flavor make it universally loved — even among those new to Indian food. Over time, the dish has become a global ambassador of Indian cuisine, featured in Indian restaurants across the world. It reflects the ingenuity of Indian chefs and how traditional techniques like tandoori cooking can be adapted to create something new and unforgettable.</p>
                    
                <p>Today, Butter Chicken is not just a comfort dish in Indian households, but a global favorite — adapted in various cultures, fusion menus, and even as pizza toppings or poutine in Canada. Its story also represents how migration, innovation, and necessity can shape culinary traditions.</p>
