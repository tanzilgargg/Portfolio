            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Tacos are a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. The origins of tacos predate the arrival of Europeans in Mexico, with evidence suggesting that indigenous people in the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish.</p>
                
                <p>The word "taco" comes from the Nahuatl word "tlahco" which means "half" or "in the middle," referring to the way it is formed. Tacos were first documented in Mexico by the Spanish conquistadors, who observed indigenous people eating tacos with a variety of fillings.</p>
                
                <p>In the 19th century, tacos began to spread beyond Mexico, particularly to the United States, where they became popular in the southwestern states. The first mention of tacos in the United States appeared in a newspaper in 1905, and by the 1920s, taco stands were common in Los Angeles.</p>
                
                <p>Today, tacos have become a global phenomenon, with countless variations and fillings. From street food to gourmet restaurants, tacos represent the perfect combination of simplicity and flavor, embodying the essence of Mexican cuisine.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>Tacos hold a special place in Mexican culture, representing centuries of culinary tradition and innovation. They originated as a practical way for Mexican silver miners to carry their lunch, wrapped in paper and containing various fillings.</p>
            <h2>Cooking Technique</h2>
